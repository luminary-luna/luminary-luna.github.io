                <p>Project Description: "Glitch Collage" was a part of a two part project. It began as a simple photo of a bundle of flowers and was given its glitch effect through manually editing the image's code. Once I was happy with its glitched state, I was able to alter it even more by using it to make a collage. It's shape is inspired by the petals of a flower. In a way, I wanted to break the image and put it back together again. </p>
